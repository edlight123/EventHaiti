- Price similarity (within ±20%): 15 points
- Upcoming soon (within 30 days): 10 points

Sorting: Highest score first, ties broken by date
```

### Trending Algorithm
```javascript
Trending Score = (recentSales * 2 + favorites) * recencyMultiplier

Where:
- recentSales = tickets sold in last 7 days
- favorites = current favorite count
- recencyMultiplier = based on event creation date
  * Created ≤7 days ago: 1.5x
  * Created ≤30 days ago: 1.2x
  * Older: 1.0x
```
