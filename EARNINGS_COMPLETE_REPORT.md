```typescript
await addTicketToEarnings(
  eventId,
  session.amount_total,
  totalTickets
)
```

### 4. Withdrawal System

#### MonCash Withdrawal
**File:** `app/api/organizer/withdraw-moncash/route.ts`

**Process:**
1. Validates amount (min $50)
2. Checks event ownership
3. Verifies settlement status = 'ready'
4. Creates `withdrawal_requests` document
5. Updates earnings (withdrawnAmount +, availableToWithdraw -)
6. Returns success with withdrawal ID

## 💰 Fee Calculation Details

### Fee Structure
```typescript
Platform Fee: 10% of gross (minimum $0.50 per ticket)
Stripe Fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
Net Earnings: Gross - Platform Fee - Stripe Fee
```

### Example Calculation
```
Ticket Price: $100.00
Gross Revenue: $100.00 (10000 cents)

Platform Fee: $10.00 (1000 cents)
  → 10% of $100 = $10.00
  → Max($10.00, $0.50) = $10.00

Stripe Fee: $3.20 (320 cents)
  → 2.9% of $100 = $2.90
  → $2.90 + $0.30 = $3.20

Net Earnings: $86.80 (8680 cents)
  → $100.00 - $10.00 - $3.20 = $86.80
```

### Configuration
**File:** `types/earnings.ts`
```typescript
export const FEE_CONFIG = {
  PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE: 0.10,
  PLATFORM_FEE_MIN: 50,
  STRIPE_FEE_PERCENTAGE: 0.029,
  STRIPE_FEE_FIXED: 30,
  MINIMUM_PAYOUT_AMOUNT: 5000,
  SETTLEMENT_HOLD_DAYS: 7,
}
```

## 🔐 Security Measures

### 1. API Authentication
All endpoints require authentication via `requireAuth()`:
```typescript
const { user, error } = await requireAuth()
if (error || !user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### 2. Ownership Validation
Withdrawal endpoints verify event ownership:
```typescript
const eventData = eventDoc.data()
if (eventData?.organizer_id !== user.id) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Not authorized' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### 3. Admin Role Check
Admin endpoints verify admin status:
```typescript
if (!isAdmin(user.email)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Admin access required' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### 4. Cron Job Security
Cron endpoint requires secret token:
```typescript
const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')
if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### 5. Firestore Rules
```javascript
// Organizers can only read their own earnings
match /event_earnings/{earningId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.organizerId == request.auth.uid;
  allow write: if false;  // Only server writes
}

// Organizers can create withdrawal requests but not update
match /withdrawal_requests/{requestId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.organizerId == request.auth.uid;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.resource.data.organizerId == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if false;  // Only server updates
}
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Firestore Indexes
All query patterns indexed for sub-100ms performance

### 2. Server Components
Dashboard pages use Server Components for server-side data fetching:
```typescript
// No client-side data fetching overhead
const earnings = await getOrganizerEarningsSummary(user.id)
```

### 3. Parallel Queries
Admin dashboard fetches event and organizer details in parallel:
```typescript
const withdrawals = await Promise.all(
  snapshot.docs.map(async (doc) => {
    const [eventDoc, organizerDoc] = await Promise.all([
      adminDb.collection('events').doc(data.eventId).get(),
      adminDb.collection('users').doc(data.organizerId).get()
    ])
    // ...
  })
)
```

### 4. Batch Updates
Cron job uses batch writes for multiple updates:
```typescript
const batch = adminDb.batch()
for (const doc of pendingEarningsSnapshot.docs) {
  batch.update(doc.ref, { settlementStatus: 'ready' })
}
await batch.commit()
```

### 5. Revalidation
Dashboard pages cached for 30 seconds:
```typescript
export const revalidate = 30
```

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

### Design Patterns
- **Cards on mobile**, tables on desktop
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44x44px)
- Bottom navigation for mobile users
- Responsive grid layouts (1 col mobile → 3-4 cols desktop)
- Scrollable modals with max-height constraints

### Breakpoints
```css
Mobile: < 768px (cards, stacked layouts)
Tablet: 768px - 1024px (2-col grids)
Desktop: > 1024px (tables, 3-4 col grids)
```

### Examples
```tsx
{/* Mobile Cards */}
<div className="md:hidden divide-y divide-gray-200">
  {earnings.map(e => <Card key={e.id} {...e} />)}
</div>

{/* Desktop Table */}
<div className="hidden md:block">
  <table>...</table>
</div>
```
