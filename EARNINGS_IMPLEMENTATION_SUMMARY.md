## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Fee Structure
```typescript
Platform Fee: 10% of gross sales (minimum $0.50 per ticket)
Stripe Fee: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
Net Earnings: Gross - Platform Fee - Stripe Fee
```

### Settlement Logic
- **Hold Period**: 7 days after event date
- **Status Transitions**:
  - `locked` → Event hasn't occurred yet
  - `pending` → Event occurred, within 7-day hold period
  - `ready` → 7+ days after event, funds available for withdrawal

### Database Schema

#### Collection: `event_earnings`
```typescript
{
  id: string
  eventId: string
  organizerId: string
  grossSales: number        // in cents
  ticketsSold: number
  platformFee: number       // in cents
  processingFees: number    // in cents
  netAmount: number         // in cents
  availableToWithdraw: number  // in cents
  withdrawnAmount: number   // in cents
  settlementStatus: 'pending' | 'ready' | 'locked'
  settlementReadyDate: string
  currency: 'HTG' | 'USD'
  lastCalculatedAt: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}
```

#### Collection: `withdrawal_requests`
```typescript
{
  id: string
  organizerId: string
  eventId: string
  amount: number           // in USD (not cents)
  method: 'moncash' | 'bank'
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  moncashNumber?: string
  bankDetails?: {
    accountNumber: string
    bankName: string
    accountHolder: string
    swiftCode?: string
    routingNumber?: string
  }
  processedBy?: string
  processedAt?: Date
  failureReason?: string
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Firestore Indexes Needed
```
event_earnings:
- organizerId + settlementStatus + createdAt (desc)
- eventId (asc) - unique per event
- organizerId + availableToWithdraw (desc)

withdrawal_requests:
- status + createdAt (desc) - for admin queue
- organizerId + status + createdAt (desc) - for organizer history
- eventId + createdAt (desc) - for per-event history
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Automatic Earnings Tracking
```bash
# Use Stripe test mode
# Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
# Date: Any future date
# CVC: Any 3 digits
# ZIP: Any 5 digits

1. Create a test event
2. Purchase tickets using Stripe test card
3. Check /organizer/earnings - should show new earnings record
4. Verify fee calculations are correct
```

### 2. Test Earnings Dashboard
```bash
1. Navigate to /organizer (main dashboard)
2. Click "View Earnings" quick action card
3. Verify summary cards show correct totals
4. Test filter tabs (All, Ready, Pending, Locked)
5. Click event row to go to per-event page
```

### 3. Test Withdrawal Flow
```bash
1. Create event with date in the past (to bypass 7-day hold)
2. Purchase tickets (generates earnings)
3. Manually set settlementStatus to 'ready' and settlementReadyDate in past
4. Navigate to /organizer/events/[id]/earnings
5. Click "MonCash" or "Bank Transfer"
6. Fill form and submit
7. Check Firestore for withdrawal_requests document
8. Verify earnings updated (withdrawnAmount increased, availableToWithdraw decreased)
```

## 📋 Admin Tasks Required

### 1. Create Firestore Indexes
Run these commands or add via Firebase Console:
```bash
firebase firestore:indexes:create \
  "event_earnings" \
  --fields "organizerId ASC, settlementStatus ASC, createdAt DESC"

firebase firestore:indexes:create \
  "withdrawal_requests" \
  --fields "status ASC, createdAt DESC"
```

### 2. Set Up Cron Job for Settlement Status
Create a cron job (or Cloud Function scheduled trigger) that runs daily:
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for cron job
async function updateSettlementStatuses() {
  const pendingEarnings = await adminDb
    .collection('event_earnings')
    .where('settlementStatus', '==', 'pending')
    .get()

  for (const doc of pendingEarnings.docs) {
    const earnings = doc.data()
    const readyDate = new Date(earnings.settlementReadyDate)
    
    if (new Date() >= readyDate) {
      await doc.ref.update({
        settlementStatus: 'ready',
        updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard for Withdrawal Processing
Create admin interface at `/admin/withdrawals` to:
- View pending withdrawal requests
- Approve/reject requests
- Mark as completed after manual processing
- Add failure reasons if needed

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Earnings not showing up**
- Check Stripe webhook is configured and firing
- Verify webhook endpoint is `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Check Firestore `event_earnings` collection

**Withdrawal button disabled**
- Verify settlementStatus is 'ready'
- Check availableToWithdraw >= $50 (5000 cents)
- Ensure event date is 7+ days in past

**Incorrect fee calculations**
- Verify FEE_CONFIG constants in types/earnings.ts
- Check calculateFees() function in lib/fees.ts
- All amounts should be in cents in database

### Debug Checklist
- [ ] Stripe webhook secret configured correctly
- [ ] Firebase admin SDK initialized
- [ ] Event has organizer_id field
