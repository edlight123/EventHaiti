# Profile Country Selection & Location-Based Discovery

## Overview

**Changes:**

### 3. Home Page Personalization

**Changes:**
- Fetch user profile to get user's `defaultCountry`
- Prioritize events from user's country in all sections
- Split events into `eventsInUserCountry` and `eventsInOtherCountries`
- Reorder to show user's country events first: `[...userCountry, ...otherCountries]`
- Featured events prioritize user's country
- Trending events show user's country first
- Upcoming This Week shows user's country first
- Added dedicated "Events in [Country]" section
- Section displays up to 6 events from user's country
- Country name dynamically shown using LOCATION_CONFIG

## Database Schema

### Users Collection (Firestore)
```typescript
{
  // Existing fields...
  default_country: string  // Country code (HT, US, CA, FR, DO)
}
```

### Events Collection (Firestore)
```typescript
{
  // Existing fields...
  country: string  // Country code where event is located
}
```

## Supported Countries

| Code | Country Name           | Cities |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| HT   | Haiti                  | 9      |
| US   | United States          | 8      |
| CA   | Canada                 | 5      |
| FR   | France                 | 6      |
| DO   | Dominican Republic     | 5      |

## User Flow

1. **Set Country Preference**
   - User navigates to Profile page
   - Clicks on Preferences tab
   - Selects country from dropdown
   - City list updates dynamically based on country
   - Selects city and subarea (optional)
   - Preference saved to Firestore automatically

2. **Personalized Discovery**
   - User navigates to Discover page
   - System fetches user profile and reads defaultCountry
   - Events filtered by user's country shown in dedicated section
   - "Events in [Country Name]" section appears after "Happening Soon"
   - User sees events relevant to their location preference

3. **Personalized Home Page**
   - User navigates to Home page
   - System fetches user profile and reads defaultCountry
   - Featured events prioritize user's country
   - Trending events show user's country first
   - New "Events in [Country]" section shows country-specific events
   - All event lists prioritize user's country

## Technical Details

### Profile Data Access
- **Server-side**: Uses `getUserProfileAdmin(userId)` for admin SDK access
- **Client-side**: Uses `getUserProfile(userId)` for client SDK access
- **Default**: All functions default to 'HT' (Haiti) if no country set
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks prevent page crashes if profile fetch fails

### Event Filtering
```typescript
// Filter events by country
export function filterEventsByCountry(events: Event[], country: string): Event[] {
  return events.filter(e => e.country === country)
}

// Prioritize user's country events
const eventsInUserCountry = events.filter(e => e.country === userCountry)
const eventsInOtherCountries = events.filter(e => e.country !== userCountry)
const prioritizedEvents = [...eventsInUserCountry, ...eventsInOtherCountries]
```

### Location Display
```typescript
// Get country name for display
const countryName = LOCATION_CONFIG[userCountry]?.name || 'Haiti'

// Display in UI
<h2>🌎 Events in {countryName}</h2>
```

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Discovery**: Users see events most relevant to their location
2. **Better User Experience**: No need to filter by country every time
3. **Increased Engagement**: Users more likely to attend events near them
4. **Multi-Country Support**: Seamlessly supports EventHaiti's expansion
5. **Cascading Selection**: Intuitive UI that prevents invalid selections
6. **Default Values**: Sensible defaults (Haiti) for existing users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Timezone Support**: Adjust event times based on country timezone
2. **Distance-Based Sorting**: Sort events by proximity within country
3. **Multi-Country Selection**: Allow users to follow multiple countries
4. **Smart Recommendations**: ML-based event suggestions by location
5. **Location History**: Track user's location changes over time
6. **Geolocation API**: Auto-detect user's country on first visit
7. **Country Analytics**: Track which countries have most users
8. **Event Notifications**: Notify when new events added in user's country
